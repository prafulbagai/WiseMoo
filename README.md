A web application using Django. The application allow users to select a photo from the computer system and keep 
populating onto the users timeline. The timeline views a list/grid of all the photos which the user has uploaded 
sorted chronologically. Initially it shows 50 photos and then a pull to refresh is made to fetch the next 50 photos 
on the timeline. The implementation works for multiple users.

The project uses 
1. Django Pagination
2. Memcache
3. Twitter Bootstrap
4. Jinja
5. PostgreSQL
